### Clustering

- [scHiCTools](https://github.com/liu-bioinfo-lab/scHiCTools) - clustering of scHi-C data. Project single cells in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Three methods for smoothing scHi-C data (linear convolution, random walk, network enhancing), three projection methods (fastHiCRep, Selfish, InnerProduct), three embedding methods if assuming cells come from a continuous manifold (MDS, t-SNE, PHATE), or three clustering methods if assuming cells are from different clusters (k-means, spectral clustering, HiCluster). Brief Methods of each approach. Tested on Nagano 2017 cell-cycle dataset. Inner product captures cell similarity well, any embedding works good, linear convolution and random walk improve projections at high dropout rates. Input - text matrices.

Dip-C - diploid chromatin conformation capture, MALBAC-DT - multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics. 3D genome separates cells into 13 structure types. Three main lineages: neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes. Correlating gene cell type-specific expression with A/B compartmentalization helps to integrate gene expression and the 3D structure. WGCNA modules of correlated genes, dynamics of those modules across time. Integration with published 3D genome, transcriptome, methylome, and chromatin accessibility data.

Overview of computational analysis of Hi-C data (normalization, A/B compartment, TAD, loop calling, differential analysis), scRNA-seq data properties. Tested on systematically downsampled data and on experimental scHi-C data. HiCnorm is most performing for normalization, Insulation Score fastHiC for TAD/loop calling. A/B compartments are poorly defined in scHi-C data, TADs can be identified at single-cell level, aggregation improves TAD detection. Adjusted mutual information and weight similarity for TAD similarity assessment. Other methods, like TAD boundary prediction from epigenomic features.

    - Haploid single cell Hi-C processed counts from Nagano et al. were obtained from the Tanay lab (http://compgenomics.weizmann.ac.il/files/archives/schic_hap_2i_adj_files.tar.gz and http://compgenomics.weizmann.ac.il/files/archives/schic_hap_serum_adj_files.tar.gz). Only cells with a total of 100,000 reads or more were used. Data were further filtered using HiFive single cell Hi-C filters. This involved removing fragment ends (fends) with no interactions, fends smaller than 21 bp or larger than 10 Kb, and all fends not originating from chromosomes 1 through 19 or X. Next, because only haploid cell data were used any fend with more than two interactions was removed and fends with exactly two interactions were removed if the interactions occurred with partner fends more than 40 fends apart; otherwise, the longer of the two interactions was kept. Finally, fends were partitioned into 1 Mb bins. (from Luperchio et al., “The Repressive Genome Compartment Is Established Early in the Cell Cycle before Forming the Lamina Associated Domains.”)
